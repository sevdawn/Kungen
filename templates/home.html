			<h1>Welcome to Sevdawn Photography!</h1>
			<p>Hello, one and all, and welcome! Lady Gin Swift, Bard of the Freakshow, at your service! I'm no pro photog, just a 
                fan with a smartphone. That said, every once in a while I can snag a good pic or three. This pic you see here is of 
				AVATAR guitarist Jonas Jarlsby, also known as "Kungen" (Swedish word for "the King") Click on the Gallery button to see
				just a few pics I've taken over the years of Kungen and his amazing band, AVATAR.

				<img src="../static/images/stage.jpg" alt="Pre show stage" class="img-fluid">
				<p>In 2014 I learned of a metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden called AVATAR and they very quickly took over
					our lives. We've seen them over 20 times in 8 different states and they are largely responsible for 
					really kickstarting my hobby of concert photography. I've taken hundreds of pictures, made countless 
					friends, and created memories that will last a lifetime.

				 	 Since 2014, we've had this amazing metal music festival in Louisville, KY called Louder than Life.
					  Our first AVATAR show, as a matter of fact, was at that first LTL. We missed the 2015 festival because of work, 
					  2018's LTL was cancelled thanks to flooding, and COVID of	course took the 2020 festival from us. This year's lineup is one 
					  of the best we've ever seen and for the first	time it's been extended to FOUR days! Would you like to know more? Click 
					  <a href="https://louderthanlifefestival.com/" class="link-danger"> here</a> for more info! </p>

				<p>We're used to seeing many concerts over the course of a year, so COVID lockdowns (while also being
					essential workers, me at Amazon and my husband as a 911 calltaker) did a real number on us. This table 
					shows our last two shows before covid lockdowns and our upcoming shows in the next few months.

					 <p>Wife, Mother, Sagittarian, Dragon, I am all of that and more. By night, I work for a local Amazon FC. Inbound is my home department, but I'm crosstrained 
				all over the building so I never know where I'll end up throughout the night. During the day, when I'm not catching up on my beauty sleep, 
				taking care of my three kids (my husband totally counts, he said so himself, so that makes 3) and the two cats, I'm learning how to be a front end web 
				developer. My husband and I own a FB fan page for the Swedish metal band Avatar. I am also quite well known for dressing up as AVATAR's vocalist Johannes Eckerstr√∂m 
				for shows and have given myself the title of Lady Gin Swift, Bard of the Freakshow. I also stream on Twitch from time to time, you can watch me be a filthy casual gamer. 
				Click the icons below to visit me on the socials, or fill out the form and drop me a line, I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!	</p>
